<h1 id="howtorun">How to use this app locally</h1> 

You can use provided sample bank statements to see the app in action, or you can use your own (look at instructions on how to feed them into the app). At the moment, the app reads bank statements manually, via a CSV file. If you would like to see your own records in action locally, download your bank statement as a CSV file and feed it into the app to see the magic.
